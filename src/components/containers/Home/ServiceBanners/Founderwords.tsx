              I start to come to work at old coal mining field about 8 month ago
              by chasing the Cheaper building to bring manufacture job back to
              usa , end up finding 2 abandoned building at this area at south
              West Virginia , then start full renovation and bring the machine
              to do manufacturing here.
              <p className="space">
                Actually lots of products we can made in usa cheaper than made
                in asia , but we do not make any calculation any more on any of
                it. By the desert of all kinds of industry , we keep losing
                industry one by one in the last 30 years, even simple wood chair
                , we ship the timber from usa to asia and then bring it back by
                imports, we lost the whole skilled work forces , loss the decent
                incomes for the family and community , end up with struggling
                minimum wage at service segment , never got chance to be decent
                life again . I did lots of study in various industry and
                products , with cheaper factory building apply with lower cost
                of building side, we can beat asian imports at both price and
                delivery . I made the trial to follow this idea.
              </p>
              <p className="space">
                During the period of time at south West Virginia , I am aware of
                the mountain around and the timber resources , I have several
                years timber trading business from 2005, buying Australian oaks
                and Canada Maples for various products purpose , along with my
                wood floor and windows factory operation. Then I sold to my
                friend to focus back my fashion business. One day , I got chance
                to visit several saw mills here. Went over all the species they
                are sawing , I found the maple list inside.
              </p>
            </p>
            <p className="space">
              I called my friend as they have the skateboarding manufacturing at
              china, asked if they can help me to build up the whole
              manufacturing process from timber to skateboarding with all list
              of machinery and maximize the automation by each step. I got the
              whole details in several weeks.
            </p>
            <p className="space">
              Often I heard local people talked about the kids has not much to
              do after school , as the skateboarding is the new Olympic medal
              sports , it does create much more phenomena during the Tokyo
              Olympic game. It could be a great products and sports for local
              kids , surely it could brew a world championship one day among
              these mountain kids. I bought 5 skateboarding illustration books
              to gift to the local elected official at my region to promote this
              idea. But I do not get any further response from them , simple it
              is normal if the place is the poorest at usa , the local
              government surely is not functional as normal !
            </p>
            <p className="space">
              By in and out , to boost this idea at more publicity way without
              local government support , I come up this 50 miles rally idea to
              invite all the professional skateboarder worldwide to do a
              marathon kinds of rally within one day , if I can invite even 50
              professional skateboarder to come to the rally, minimum I could
              encourage the kids and youth to love this sports with all kinds of
              dream they can have . Maybe lift them at different good path for
              their future. I made all the plan with my team , but I can not run
              this kinds of events alone. I proposed again, the lack of support
              at local government is obviously . I feel puzzled whether we
              should push or leave it alone for the future .

              Several months ago, one of region publisher reported one of my
              business activity at their newspaper and we start to know each
              other , Mr Jeff Vanderbeck invited me to visit Logan by my
              next trip. Finally I got chance to be back the region, then I
              drove over the border to Logan, once I start to enter the
              region of Logan, I found some easy contrast difference between
              the two area , a very clean and organized city show up from the
              border , highway is well maintained. Very tidy every place coming
              to the eye. Well decorated town with all clean building exterior.
              Jeff brought me around the whole city. Even a big garage for free
              parking. I travelled many place, the city shows me the quality and
              potential development to be similar as Park city UT or Boulder CO
              . Jeff introduce the city manager Philip and executive development
              director Jill for a hour meeting , we introduced each other,
              certainly the contrast of the way of governing compare the current
              location is obvious .
            </p>
            <p className="space">
              I start to present this idea to the city , from events to
              manufacturing the skateboarding . The wishes for the kids to be
              world class championship after initial this events. Then carry out
              years to come , become a once a year big rally Events for world
              wide professional skateboarder. From our timber at the mountain to
              turn to be the finish products , weave most of the dream of the
              kids , bring the manufacturing job back, with fully sustainable
              supply chain from resource to finish products at one location, I
              believe it could be a good example for anyone interested to bring
              the manufacturing job back to your hometown or community you are
              caring , we could transform a new kinds of globalization with
              local manufacturing as main core of supply chain close by , fully
              balance with cost and healthy community life . Also we can make
              local events as global phenomena!
            </p>
            <p className="space">Here is the case , we seek all of you to support our dream !</p>
